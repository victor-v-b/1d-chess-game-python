python game project made in 2023 where you play chess on a single horizontal line instead of a 2d board. 

instructions:
side arrow keys to navigate between chess pieces
up/down arrow keys to select/place pieces according to their movement restrictions

chess pieces are currently in portuguese:
R = Rei (can move one slot to left/right)
C = Cavalo (can move 2 slots to left/right and can jump over pieces)
T = Torre (can move any distance to left/right)
P = Pe√£o (can move one two or one slots to the right)

UI made with curses library
